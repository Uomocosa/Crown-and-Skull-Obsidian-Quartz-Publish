Scholars tell of a powerful ring that he uses to channel immense power. If the ring could be stolen... Longshadow’s newest plot could be foiled... ‘*If you can fi nd the wizard’s new stronghold... he’ll keep the ring somewhere safe... not simply slipped onto a fi nger. A vault perhaps, or some high chamber hidden away...*’

Rumor has it the rider cannot be killed, but can only be defeated by sending him back to the dimension the came from... but how? ‘*I saw the rider out on Pete’s Bluff... just staring into the sunset, that black hat against the sky. A demon, I say! A demon from another time!*’
