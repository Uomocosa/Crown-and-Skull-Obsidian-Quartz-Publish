After several perilous chapters, a character earning **25 or more hero points** in play (not at creation) will earn the attention of mighty forces. This hero is ready to make the ultimate choice: the CROWN or the SKULL? 

Once this threshold has been crossed, the ***GM*** will find an opportune moment to pose this question as part of the ongoing story. The deliverer of this choice will be a familiar lord, king, mentor, or trusted ally. Larger forces are at work, and a call to greater duties arrives at last.

----
“*You stand before me a hero of the realm. Your deeds have not gone unnoticed. No longer can you chase whims or petty treasures. Yours is a mighty calling, adventurer. Make your choice!*” With that, the king opens his hand, revealing two silver rings. One is carved with a seven-eyed skull, the other, a high-tined crown. He waits patiently. All eyes are on you.

Since the fall of the world’s unity three decades ago, many heroes have faced this choice. It has become tradition... a sacrament to lend order to a chaotic world. The CROWN is not simply ‘the good guys’ nor is the SKULL wanton evil. The question is a matter of alignment with larger forces at work in The North Holds.

For players, your job is to announce when **25 hero points** have been earned. For the ***GM***, you are charged with weaving this choice into the campaign naturally. Before we look at what’s at stake, here are a few pointers.

- ***Sacred Rite***: When presenting this moment in play, ***GMs***, be sure to pause the story a bit, revel in this moment. Heralds take the knee, trumpets sound. ^sacred-rite

- ***The Ring Itself***: For added effect, offer two actual rings to the player(s) about to choose. Spare no bravado in their presentation. ^the-ring-itself

- ***Consider the Group***: Some groups may prefer to all reach the 25 point threshold together, some independently. Survey their preference. ^consider-the-group

- ***The Only Chance***: This choice is only offered once. If a hero refuses to choose, they will be scorned widely, possibly deemed an enemy to all. ^the-only-chance

### The CROWN
Those who choose the CROWN will join an order of protectors, knights, and heralds sworn to the well-being of the realm, the sanctity of all life, and the upholding of ancient codes. They swear to honor the decrees of kings and queens, to serve as a beacon of truth and loyalty.
- Gain 6 hero points 
- Choose any **1** [[Crown Skills|crown skill]] at no cost, value **9** 
- Choose any **1** [[Crown Equipment|crown equipment]] at no cost
- Take the ‘***Crown-Sworn***’ flaw: *If you disobey a royal summons, edict or order and are caught doing so, the penalty is death*.
- Gain a Ring of the Anvil’s Light: Roll **9** or less on a `d20` to heal **1** [[Attrition|skill attrition]] for all close allies. Also, add `+1d4` to their [[Armor and Defense • Player DEF|Defense]] until your next turn.


“*I knew it! Sound the bells! Bring forth a silver cloak and goblet of ale! The ranks of good have another in their phalanx! Look, ye evil doers, on this fellowship, on this shield wall, and despair! I honor you, crown-sworn*.”

### The SKULL
Those who choose the SKULL will join no order, swear allegiance to no one, and walk the world as a masterless rogue. They will spare no method or dark power to see their deeds done. They trust their own wisdom over the laws of kingdoms or motives of kings. Free to choose their own path, they will be honored by others who stand defi ant, self-contained.
- Gain **9 hero points** 
- Choose any **1** [[Skull Skills|skull skill]] at no cost, value **9** 
- Choose any **1** [[Skull Equipment|skull equipment]] at no cost 
- Take the ‘**Ronin**’ flaw: *Unless in disguise, you will be identified and unwelcome in any high hall, throne room, council chamber, or royal household. Even in taverns and markets you will be seen as suspicious*. 
- **Gain a Ring of the Skull**: When you make a kill, gain `1d12`. Store this until desired to add or subtract from any roll you make in the future.

“*Fascinating. I see in you no need for the straight path. No lord or land will you keep, no law will you endure... shadow-walker, king slayer. So be it, but choose wisely how you use this mighty freedom, ronin. A skull with too many enemies is short-lived. Until then, I bid you good luck. Now go*.”
