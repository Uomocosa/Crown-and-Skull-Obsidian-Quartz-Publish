When our heroes have done more than survive, more than gain wealth and equipment and infl uence, but instead have risked their lives for the good of all and emerged victorious... when these moments occur, the realm acknowledges a mighty deed. Deeds provide 3 benefi ts to players...

----
- ***[[Deed - Hero points|Hero Points]]***: When a deed is done, each character receives **3 hero points**. These can be spent (if in a safe place) or saved for later. A deed should be awarded every other session or so. Listed here are the primary moments deeds are awarded by the ***GM***... ^hero-points
	- Completing a session with flair. “*You guys, that was amazing. Consider a mighty deed done! Take 3 hero points, all of ya*.”
	- Executing legendary or pivotal actions in play. “*That critical didn’t just collapse the cavern, it sealed the horrors behind a wall of rock for all time? Ha! Consider that a mighty deed!*”
	- Returning to goodly folk who cheer for their courage and aid. “*Wallabytarnwhatwallaby sheds a single tear as you return to town. Children run to meet you, and banners stream in the air. The deed is done! Victory at last!*”

- ***[[Deed - Closure|Closure]]***: Normally, the dangerous situations facing ordinary folk get worse and worse until our heroes come to help. Once a deed is done for such people, the decay of circumstances fi nally halts. This lets players move on to other exploits with no worries or loose ends. “*With the goblins vanquished, and the caverns destroyed, Gardenburrow will never be threatened again!*” ^closure

- ***[[Deed - Renown|Renown]]***: When word spreads of the heroes’ mighty accomplishments, bards and poets will begin to assign them titles and nicknames... ^renown

*Ah, the sound of cheering townsfolk and laughing goats! I may have gone soft in my golden years, but there’s no better feelin’ in life than to return to folk made safe, have an ice cold bath, and drink until the sun rises anew. To the crown!*
