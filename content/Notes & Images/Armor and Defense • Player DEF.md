Defense is a crucial aspect of your CROWN and SKULL character. Any time enemies attack, they make no roll... it’s up to you to roll Defense!

- ***All characters receive Defense 6 at no cost... basic clothes***.
- ***Add additional armor values to determine total Defense value***. 
- ***Damaged or destroyed armor no longer contributes to this value***. 
- ***Max 18***.

### Using Backup Armor
When loading up on armor, duplicates can be carried, but only one of a type/body location can be worn to boost **Defense**. You can’t wear two helmets, for example. 
That said, backups can be carried in your [[Total Invetory|10 item slots]], but only one of a type/body location counts toward your Defense. 
Backup armor is just as vulnerable to [[Attrition|attrition]] as worn armor or any other equipment. This gives ‘tank’ heroes many vectors of strategy.

----
### Damaged/Destroyed
When hit by an enemy, you can ‘[[Attrition#Cross ‘Em Off|cross off]]’ a piece of armor as your [[Attrition|attrition]]. 
Most commonly, this means the armor is damaged beyond use. Some foes with [[corrosive]] or ‘[[sundering]]’ attacks will destroy armor, not just damage it. **Delete the item from your inventory permanently**.

### The Armorer Skill
All heavy armor fighters worth their weight are trained in the repair of armor. The [[Skill - Armorer|armorer]] allows an armor user to ‘self-heal’ with a successful skill roll. Fall back, strap down a dented bracer, charge!

----
### Precious Space
With the tightly limited inventory of your character, you’ll find that there is often little room for armor, forcing the kinds of tough choices that make teamwork essential.

*Aye, I carry three shields most days, and a canoe paddle for good measure. I find that schlepping the damn things is better than fighting back a pack of ice wolves with a pair of mittens and harsh language, but that’s just me*.
