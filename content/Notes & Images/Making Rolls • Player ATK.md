### Flat Roll
To test simple, unmodified luck, the ***GM*** may call for a ‘flat’ roll.
This simple roll is made on a `d20`, rolling at or below the target or opposing roll to succeed. 
“*You grab hold of the anchor chain to pull, but a fish-man is pulling from below the waves! Let’s see who can roll lowest on a D20!*”

----
### Player-Declared Skill Roll
Often during play, you will announce “*I will roll my jump skill to leap over this creek!*” or some equivalent. 
Roll `1d20` at or below that [[Skills|skill]]’s listed value to succeed. 
In some cases, a difficulty penalty will reduce the skill’s value. Note that many specialized or athletic actions are simply not possible without a working skill! 
“*You strain to bend the bars, but without a Muscle skill, you accomplish nothing!*”

----
### Called-For Defense Roll
**Enemies do not make attack rolls!** 
When attacked, the ***GM*** will ask you to roll [[Armor and Defense • Player DEF|Defense]]. 
Roll at or below this value to avoid injury from the incoming attack. An enemy stat, [[Enemy Primer • Enemy HP, ATK, DEF, PHASE, TACTICS|ATK]], will act as a penalty to reduce your Defense rolls. 
“*The serpent lashes out at you! The viper has ATK 3, so roll Defense with a -3 penalty!*”

----
### Rolling Damage/Effect
**There is no ‘to-hit’ roll in CROWN and SKULL!** 
When you attack, you roll damage instantly! 
This roll can use a wide variety of dice. Add the total rolled for damage inflicted. This roll can be reduced by an enemy stat called [[Enemy Primer • Enemy HP, ATK, DEF, PHASE, TACTICS|DEF]].

----
### Yes/No Rolls
When important yes/no questions come up, and the ***GM*** doesn’t have an answer, roll `1d6`. 
- 1, 2, 3: ***NO***. 
- 4, 5, 6: ***YES***.

----
### All Other Rolls
*How long until the boat arrives? How many houndmasters are there? How tall is the statue? How much armor does this knight have?* All kinds of numbers are needed and rolled for in play.
Be flexible, ready for anything, and trust the dice absolutely.
