Phases are a unique aspect of CROWN and SKULL. They divide time into bite-size pieces, and give player turns order, timing, and detail as each scene unfolds. Enemies also uses phases to act.

---
### The 5 Phases
Think of phases as cool moments in an action scene. A collection of these moments is called a round. Which phase a hero takes action is a meaningful choice for timing and strategy. 
There are no ‘held actions’ here (as in many RPGs), and your phase is locked for the encounter once chosen, so choose with intent!

----
### Choosing a Phase
Generally, players will agree on which phase is best, especially after a few battles inform their decision. 
- What phase a character chooses can be changed, but not mid-combat. 
- Players can also choose the same phase. 

Track your choice on your character sheet here.:<br>![[Pasted image 20240614113502.png]]

### On Your Phase
When your phase comes up, it’s your turn to act. You have three options, listed below:
- ***Move***: Move elsewhere in the scene, about `15 cm` table space. A small ‘sidestep’ move is allowed without using one’s phase.
- ***Perform an Action***: Make an attack, use a skill, cast a spell or perform one discreet action. This takes your entire phase.
- ***Hurry***: If you need to move AND do something in one turn, your haste opens up your Defenses with clumsy haste. All enemies in the scene gain +5 ATK against you for 1 round. **Hurry can only be used for a move+action combo, not dual action or dual move**.

----
### Enemy Phases
**Foes will act in 1-3 phases per round!**
A monster attacking in phases 1, 3, and 5, **for example**, will keep an entire team of heroes occupied! Any time enemies and heroes share a phase, heroes go first.

----
### The GM Call
During play, the ***GM*** will keep things cruising along by ‘calling’ for actions during a phase.
“*Ok, it’s now phase 3, who’s up? Lucy, that’s you! The wolves are coming in fast, what will you do?*”
