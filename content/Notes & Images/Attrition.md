Sustaining damage from hazards and attacks is part of any RPG. You’ll be hit by arrows, knock your head, sustain sword cuts, or drop items when exhausted. 
Attrition is a term for the reduction of your character’s resources when hit by hazards and attacks. 
Here’s how it works... 

***WHEN INJURED, CROSS OFF EQUIPMENT AND/OR SKILLS***

----
### Cross ‘Em Off
When you’re hurt, you’ll be losing use of your skills and gear! Crossed-off equipment and skills cannot be used until restored or repaired. Role play it! 
Attrition impairs your senses, physical wellness, or equipment beyond use. In some cases, items may be lost permanently, but skills are never permanently lost. A few simple rules govern attrition.
