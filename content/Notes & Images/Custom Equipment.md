Gear is king for the life of an adventurer! It’s cheap, lying around, and often quite awesome in creative hands. In CROWN and SKULL, hero points can be used to acquire and upgrade equipment. 
Like all pointspending in the game, this can only be done while resting in a safe place with the aid of an expert... in this case, a smith, mentor, or artificer. 

Gear is like most things in CROWN and SKULL: it has a **base cost**, gets more expensive with effects, and earns a discount with **limitations**. This allows you to buy a super simple dagger, or craft a very specific magic item all with the same value system. Any given effect added to gear can only be applied **ONCE PER ITEM**, though an item may have multiple effects.

*Keep it simple, laddy. Pay an extra 3 points to make that sword deadly. Even this simple level of gear customization can give ye an edge in battle. Me? I prefer all my armor be cold iron forged... only way to be sure!*

### Upgrading your Gear
During play, your character will receive hero points for completing sessions. If used to upgrade gear, consider these key rules:
- Customizations are added for 3 points as normal.
- Upgrading gear can only be done at a smithy or artisan.
- Limitations cannot be added as part of an upgrade.
- All effects can only be applied to a single item once, no stacking.
- The final cost of a piece of gear can never be less than 1 point.
