As a supplement to your free Player’s Guide, here is a brief, condensed introduction to enemies in CROWN and SKULL.

***Enemies have 5 STATS: HP, ATK, DEF, PHASE, and TACTICS***

---
- ***HP***: A simple pool of hit points. At 0 hit points, the foe is killed.

- ***ATK***: Enemies do not roll their attacks. Rather, players defend with their own rolls. The ATK stat is a [[Making Rolls • Player ATK#Called-For Defense Roll|penalty]] to a player [[Armor and Defense • Player DEF|Defense]] roll. 

- ***DEF***: Enemies have Defenses to resist attack. [[Making Rolls • Player ATK#Rolling Damage/Effect|DEF is subtracted from a hero damage roll]]. Some attacks degrade DEF, such as the degrading armor.

- ***PHASE***: Enemies take actions in 1 or more of the [[Phases|5 phases]] in a round, **up to 3 phases maximum per round**! 

- ***TACTICS***:
	- When their phase comes up, monsters do 1-3 actions called tactics. As GM, roll a D6 to select a tactic.
		- Tactic roll 1 (displacement, dash, movement, target change or regroup)
		- Tactic roll 2-5 (common attack) 
		- Tactic roll 6 (area of effect attacks that hit all or all-near foes)
	- A tactic will also include what type of attrition it will inflict... 
		- **Basic**: When hit, victim chooses any **1 skill or equipment inventory** to [[Attrition#Cross ‘Em Off|mark off]]. Equipment is only damaged.
		- **Flesh**: When hit, victim rolls `d10`, marks off the indicated skill.
		- **Equipment**: When hit, randomly select and [[Attrition#Cross ‘Em Off|cross off]] **1 equipment**. Equipment is only damaged, not destroyed.
		- **Destroy**: When hit, [[Attrition#Cross ‘Em Off|cross off]] **1 randomly selected skill** and [[Armor and Defense • Player DEF#Damaged/Destroyed|destroy]] **1 randomly selected piece of equipment**. 
		- **Brutal**: When hit, victim [[Attrition#Cross ‘Em Off|mark off]] `1d6` combined skill and equipment inventory, randomly selected.
	- **Move-to-Engage**: Enemies need not be bound to tactics rolls at all times. They may just move-to-engage, getting in attack position or range before rolling tactics. Enemies tend to use move-to-engage to reach their most recent or most severe attacker.
