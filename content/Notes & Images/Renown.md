Renown is the inevitable result of heroic action, acknowledged by folk of the realm and GM alike as deeds. When these pile up, the honor of title is bestowed on our band of adventurers. Here are a few guidelines...

----
- ***[[Renown - 3 Deeds]]***: After a few exploits, a hero or group receives a title derived from a famous doing. Examples of this could be ‘spider-slayer,’ ‘boulder breaker,’ or ‘the wild man of Mooncrest.’ Stories have begun to circulate about deeds done, but most folk wouldn’t recognize the heroes if they saw them. You are little more than a rumor or tavern tall tale. ^3-deeds

- ***[[Renown - 5 Deeds|5 Deeds]]***: After so many doings, our heroes acquire actual titles either individually or as group. ‘Knight Errant,’ ‘Commander,’ ‘Warmaster,’ or ‘Forest Mother’ come to mind. Folk recognize our heroes more often, and refer them by proper title to show respect. Vendor prices drop, ales are bought aplenty by admirers and well-wishers. ^5-deeds

- ***[[Renown - 10 Deeds|10 Deeds]]***: Here the greatest heroes fi nd their place in history. If awarding deeds every other session or so, this would be *20 sessions of play*. For some groups, that’s an entire year of campaigning! At this stage, our heroes’ renown is legend. They become part of the ‘world lore’ of The North Holds. They are offered a fortress, village, or outpost by lord and lady. Some folk even kneel or swear fealty to such heroes. Titles for renown of this level could be ‘Lord,’ ‘Baron,’ ‘Duchess,’ ‘Arch Druid,’ or ‘High Priest.’ ^10-deeds

At this level of play, our protagonists will be ready to take on the largest perils of the day: plan with kings and generals to end wars, slay titanic monsters, protect the ascension of royalty, stand for the Crown or the Skull, explore other dimensions, prevent cosmic calamities, or rescue entire towns from destruction. 

Often, somewhere beyond this level, characters are retired and treated as mighty avatars of The Holds, fading into the background for a new group of up-and-coming characters our players create in their own wake. This is when things become truly interesting...
