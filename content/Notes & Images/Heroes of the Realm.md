- ***[[Heroes of the Realm - Greentooth|Greentooth]]*** ^greentooth
	- *Location*: The Bleeding Tree near Blood Manor
	- *Widely Known*: Greentooth is the older sister of Bloodwing the Destroyer. She is, perhaps, the oldest being in The Holds. She takes the form of a colossal green dragon and a withered old woman.

Thus, she seeks allies to aid her causes.
	- *Quest*: The Blood of Kellos: After a recurring dream of Greentooth soaring over the Stormkeepers, heroes are mysteriously drawn to the old woman’s hut near the Bleeding Tree. She explains that deep below the forest, an ancient evil is growing, poisoning the roots of the old oak with congealed blood-ichor. Taking dragon form, she offers to shuttle the heroes to a remote crag of solid bedrock in the hills south of the tree, where a great fi ssure has opened a path into the cavernous realm below. ‘*Down and through and under the stones, seek the eye of Kellos and all his blood-soaked bones, to root out the poison and heal the tree... go in the darkness to fi nally see.*’

	- *Location*: Ruinmoor
	- *Widely Known*: Zipler was a warrior bard beloved by all The Holds in his day, during the breaking of the Bloodwing War. By strange fate he came to wield Ruin, the starfallen sword of legend.

Now, rumor spreads that Ruin has been found by the prophet Threya, and Zipler’s ghost has risen with dire warnings.
	- *Quest*: The Starfallen Sword: Encountering or seeking out Zipler’s phantom, our heroes will be asked to help with the retrieval of the deadly weapon, that it may be safeguarded once more.

She requires a group of adventurers to infi ltrate and investigate Dragon Tooth tower. Her plan? Lure the dragon guard out with court politics. The reason? A strange dragon was sighted during a new moon, barely visible in the lightless sky, visiting Dragon Tooth. Since then, a brood of eggs has appeared. If all this be true, it can only mean one thing: Hydranax the Hungry has returned to Dragon Tooth, and means to roost there. If the dragon guard is hiding this, they are already corrupted by the blue dragon’s magic. ‘*Go to the highest crags and fi nd what you can. All depends on this.*’

	- *Quest*: A Humble End: Hearing of our heroes’ deeds, Osrigard sends an invitation to the log-tossing festival at Kaargfort, promising the greatest revelry the realm has to offer. In truth, he seeks an errand from the adventurers. After a lifetime of heroism, he now wishes only to settle down and be of use to his community. He takes our heroes aside, revealing a secret... much of his power and success is owed to a magic jade pebble. This arcane stone was loaned to him by an old hermit who lives in the remote area of Greenstone. He begs the heroes to venture there, and to return the stone to the old man for him, with utmost discretion. He has so many admirers and dreamers around him, he would hate to disappoint them with knowledge of the pebble. ‘*Will you take this back to the old man? Will you offer this knight one fi nal request... that I may know a humble end?*’
