Once you have a sense for the basic flow of the game, it’s time to get into some nuts and bolts decisions to build a playable character. Grab a CROWN and SKULL character sheet, or just use your trusty journal to jot down skills and ideas, or start drawing the ever-important character portrait! To build your character...

----
### For Beginners: Templates and Prompts
To get right into rolling dice with no hassle, choose a [[Hometowns|hometown]] then choose a [[Character Templates|character template]].
This will get you started playing instantly without learning the point-build system. You can also use the [[Character Prompts]] to get story and background ideas flowing for your new character.

----
### For Experienced Players: Custom Built Characters
 For more fielded RPG veterans, CROWN and SKULL features a robust, indepth point buy creation system. This super-flexible method lets you create everything using hero point costs and discounts... even [[Custom Spells|spells]], [[Custom Equipment|equipment]], and [[Companions|companions]].

----
### And Beyond: Hero Points
No matter how you create your character, you’ll gain experience in play with hero points.
These can spent to add [[Skills|skills]], [[Spells • The Defaults|spells]], or **equipment** to a character using the same rules and options custom characters use. You can save them up or spend as you go.

**Every 10 hero points earned**, you’ll gain a bonus reward specific to your [[Hometowns|hometown]].

All the rules you need for this growth process are right here in the Player’s Guide. Good luck out there, hero.

*When building or expanding a character, always feel free to make bad decisions. It’s a tough world out there, not everything we experience makes us better. Me? I spend every point I can get on Resist. Better for quaffin’.*
