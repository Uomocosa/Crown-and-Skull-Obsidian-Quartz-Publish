CROWN and SKULL really shines most when using the custom creation system below. Hero points are used to ‘buy’ every detail. In the following pages you’ll fi nd everything you need to build a fully custom character. If you have an idea that isn’t listed, just work with your GM to add new bits.

Create your custom character following the steps below. 

Creating customized spells and equipment is a learned skill as a player, so don’t be surprised if it takes some time and attention. This is where the hero point system truly shines with a little ingenuity and a clear character concept to guide your decisions.

----

***STEP 1: Starting Points***: All characters start with **50 hero points** to spend on their build. You’ll be keeping track of your running point total as you work, so don’t be shy with making a mess on the page.

***STEP 2: [[Flaws|Choose Flaw(s)]]***: Visualize your new character. What is a weakness or stress point for them? Flaws imply history and drive believable role play. 
- Take a **maximum 2** at creation, and **maximum 4** in the character’s lifetime. 
- Each flaw adds **5 points** to your point total.
- **Flaws are entirely optional!** 

***STEP 3: [[Core Ability|Core Ability]]***: Choose a core ability and deduct **15 points** for its acquisition. This is one of the most useful mechanical aspects of your character, and **you can only ever choose one**, so choose wisely! 
- **You can also choose NONE** here and save the 15 points for other ideas.

***STEP 4: [[Skills|Choose Skills]]***: Skills are the majority of rolls you’ll be making in play. **Just roll a D20, at or below the skill value to succeed**. Sometimes, the GM may place a penalty on this roll, so high skills are a welcome friend! Outfit your character with a handful of skills that fi t your concept. 
- **Skills are purchased at 1-to-1 point value**, meaning a skill of 6 would cost 6 points and so on. 
- **No skill can be higher than 18 or lower than 3**. 
- **10 skills max in inventory**.

***STEP 5: [[Custom Equipment|Buy & Customize Equipment]]***: Visualize your character and spend your precious points on the equipment you need to satisfy the concept. 
There will plenty of time in play to earn hero points and buy more equipment, so focus on essentials. Record damage and details for any weapons equipped. If creating a very specific idea, like a priest with a talking sword, dive into the custom equipment rules and be creative!
- Add the total value of armor equipped and record it as your [[Armor and Defense • Player DEF|Defense]]. 
- You’ll roll a `d20` at or under that value when attacked.
- **10 items max in equipment inventory**.

***STEP 6: [[Custom Spells|Buy, Customize, or Scratch-Build Spells]]***: Of all the steps in custom character creation, none is more nuanced and ‘DIY’ than creating spells. 
This takes a flair for magic creativity, a good handle of effects and limitations, and your GM to make a few calls on the magic you’re creating. 
All this odd work will be especially satisfying to the dedicated wizardplayer. 
For even more options, see [[The Path of Magic]].

***STEP 7: [[Companions|Acquire & Customize a Companion]]***: If your character concept includes a small familiar, falcon, pet or mount, use these rules and pay the points needed.

***STEP 8: [[Lineage|Choose Your Lineage]]***: There are five lineages to choose from, each offers a bit of flavor for your place in the world.

***Finish***: Clean up left over points (is there such a thing?) or reduce skill values to make ends meet. If you like, you can even save a handful of hero points for spending after a session or two. The possibilities with this style of character creation are limitless... they just take some hobby-brain, pen and paper, and the ever-important character concept. You got this!

*In a system with no stats and no hit points, your challenge is to capture a character concept with skills and equipment as the focus. **When you’re hit, you’ll be losing use of skills and gear, so there are many vectors of strategy here!***
