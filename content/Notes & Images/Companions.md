It’s dangerous to go alone! On the dark adventures ahead, you may have need of a falcon, a hunting dog, or even a paid retainer or scribe.  In CROWN and SKULL these are called companions. You can customize a companion much like a spell or piece of prized equipment. 

With a clear concept of your companion in mind, get a heap of points ready to spend, and use the rules below. 

The most important thing to remember with companions is that they will not serve to double your actions in combat. A companion action counts as your own. You operate as one! This keeps companion characters from overtaking the table.

- ***[[Companion's Skill - 5-Point Companion|5-Point Companion]]*** (*Medium sized beasts or simple devices*)<br>Dogs, cats, falcons, owls, or even small pigs count as medium-sized. Also in this group are tiny devices such as mechanical animals, orbs or smaller automatons. The latter should be very rare in any campaign.

The ***GM*** should be prepared to manage the mechanics and story for such a companion, without allowing them to consume more table time than any other character type.<br>`d8` attacks, $\kern7px$ **3** [[#Companion Skill List|skills]] value at **9**, $\kern7px$ **9** [[Armor and Defense • Player DEF|Defense]] ^12-point-companion
