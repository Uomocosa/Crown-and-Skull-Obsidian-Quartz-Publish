  - Custom Spell Effects
  - Custom Spell Limitations
---
Creating and modifying spells is an art in itself, and may take some practice. Much like the wizards of old, you’ll be scheming how limitations and effects can counterbalance one another, or how a simple upgrade could make a [[Basic Spells|Basic Spell]] all it needs to be. 
Settle in to the ancient library, and ponder the mysteries of *Custom Spells*...

----
The simplest way to begin your wizard’s journey is to customize Basic Spells. Once you have some hero points to spend, consider these options: 
- Spend **3 points** for each new effect to be added 
- Add **limitations**, reducing spell cost by **3** for each, **1 pt minimum cost** 
- **You must be in a safe place to customize spells** 
- **No single effect can be stacked more than 3 times total** 

---
When Basic Spells will no longer fulfill the desired level of magical craft, you are ready to create spells from scratch. 
This assumes you have a solid working knowledge of spell-casting in general, with specific outcomes in mind. Here’s all you need to know:
- Give the new spell an evocative name that implies its function 
- Select one effect as focal or use a [[Basic Spells|Basic Spell]] as a starting point. Stack on effects as desired, tracking cost as you go. Each effect raises the spell cost by **3**. No single effect can be stacked more than **3** times total 
- Add limitations to the spell to get its cost down as needed. Each limitation reduces spell cost by **3**. Cost can never be less than **1 point** 
- You must be in a safe place for **1 day** or more to create new spells 
- Check in with your ***GM*** to get the final approval on your new spell 

----
Wizards have many ways of studying their craft. As an introduction to spell creation, consider visualizing a well-known spell from your role-playing past... 

Blasts of fire, for example, are a staple for all adventurer-mages. Use the spell creation rules to create such a well-known spell, getting a feel for effect and limitation combinations. Don’t see what you have in mind? Work with your GM to add effects or limitations as needed.
