# Foreword
Welcome to CROWN and SKULL, a new RPG system and setting created from hundreds of hours of play in several player groups over a three year period. My groups are always seeking new ways to play. This book represents a coalescence of our latest and greatest themes, mechanics, monsters, and mapless maps. 

The system here will prove a signifi cant departure from the deeply ingrained ‘`d20`’ genre that has seen such meteoric growth in recent years. As such, settle in for a brain-tickling ride into new mindsets and methods. If you feel a bit challenged by the player-focused aspects of the system, that means you’re in the sweet spot. This may be that long-overdue moment you and your group break into new territory.

No small amount of inspirational credit must be given to Steven Peterson and his team on Fantasy Hero 1st edition (1985), Steve Jackson and the GURPS team (1986), and David Wesely/Dave Arneson and their realms of Braunstein/Blackmoor (1969/1971). These creations were my initiation into role-playing, along with many others, and made a formative mark on my young mind. Also, Into the Odd (Chris McDowall) and Cairn (Yochai Gal) must be mentioned for their infl uences. Veterans of those rules and worlds will see their ghosts fl itting here and there in the pages ahead, but in spirit only. No one artifact of those brilliant works can be found here, nor is any compatibility or direct link inferred or included. 

Special and infinite thanks go to my stalwart players: The Council of Magi, Dirty Jobs, The Cypher Rebellion, and The Immortals. They are the soil in which this game grows. Their patience and incredible role play gave rise to many of the dark and hopeful truths in these pages. 

Settle in with pen and journal, mighty reader, and let me tell you of the days after the Bloodwing War, when nations fell and shadows sharpened. This is The North Holds, and there are few roads here... 

*Ever grateful, ever strong -Runehammer*

# A Leaning Stone
Castigere drifted down from the lichen-choked stones, weightless, white robe waving in a centuries-lost breeze. His transparent form was luminous, but waning with each moment. The light of elder days was failing, even in the vapors of a ghost. Without sound he alighted, holding out a gentle hand to Adelaide. She knew no fear in his presence, no matter what realm he hailed from, living or dead... Castigere was her teacher, her patron, her saint. His presence was like a cool spring on a warm day. 

“*Addy, you hang your head so low, what troubles you?*” The voice was reverberant, distant. The sound was barely a whisper, loud as thunder. 

“*Father, I have just had a waking dream, a veil pulled over my eyes on a morning walk... the wandering mist couldn’t cool me. I couldn’t wake from the fl ight of it. My feet barely touched the road. It was... terrible.*” 

“You have always had a gift for far-sight, Adelaide. The Great One has given you the eyes of an eagle. What do you see?” 

“*A world in gloom and candlelight. Spider webs on hillock heaped, and Ruinmoor howling with dead wind. The bones of dragons dead and gone, a tree soaked in blood, creaking ropes, lightless water, and sinister laughter in catacombs dim.*” 

“*Your time in the abbey is coming to an end. We live in an age of leaning stone and crumbling rooftops, and your stout heart is needed... out there... out on those vanishing roads...*” Castigere looked out across the Fairfi eld Hills. The icy summit of Folson’s Peak was bright in the early day; even the gloomy Shadow Glades had sun-kissed treetops. 

She didn’t want to, but she nodded, acknowledging the truth of Castigere’s council. She was a student no more. Her vision was all-too simple, a thinly hidden view of the subconscious... it was, in a word, fear. This fear she compacted, tucked away in a shadowy corner... watched as Catigere’s ethereal form drifted and dissipated like a plume of white butterfl ies. The sun crested the ridge, sending long, angular rays into the valley. The chimneys of Slimshire hosted lazy tendrils of breakfast smoke.

The abbey was behind her now, a mile up the zig-zagging trail, blue with distance, tiny against the darkening sky. A storm was gathering, billowing down from Stonemark. It was seldom this cold in spring, but the wind had a bite that kept her cloak wrapped snug. 

Ahead, the waymarker of Saint Sarraf, a blocky oblong of granite, leaned to one side. It had stood for over 300 years in this spot, but each year the monolith sagged further. It was a disquiet feeling to see such a mass of rock at such a pitch... as if it could topple and end the age of light at any second. Past this Adelaide walked. Her bundle was simple: great sword in a clothclad scabbard, wool blanket, a gourd fask carved with leaves, then camping pouch and nested daggers. high boots were perfect in this cool air, and her chain was kept quiet by a Fairfield arming coat and tabard. Black and white were her sleeves, bunching at the gauntlet. Her brown hair she let fly, walking alone and putting on no airs. 

Before the descent to town and whatever this crumbling world would call upon her, she stopped, leaning on the guard of the broad blade like a drunk at the tavern, looking back at Sarraf ’s stone. Thee breeze caught her pommel-banner, a bright red strand of cloth. In that moment, the world had never felt so immense, so ripe with danger, so dark with dooms yet hidden. There were no spear-guards walking the old roads, no borders, no toothless scholars giggling at the crossroads, no lantern-lit shelves of books kept. Time had been cruel to the realm, and when a thing is wounded, it is delicate as a sparrow’s wing. 

Someone had to protect what was left of these lands. Someone had to nurture them back to health, to believe former heights within reach, to rally the stumbled, to burn away the webs. She smiled to herself, proud, feeling Castigere’s ghost in those thoughts. 

Across hill and dale, beyond river and mountain, above marsh-soaked lows and in stone-walled mazes beneath the world, all Adelaide feared was stirring, and planning, and seething, and growing with evil power. 

If the realm was to be saved from those dripping fangs, it would not be easy.

# Concepts & Content
Before we dive into the process of imagining an entire world, numerous storylines, possible heroes and villains, game mechanics, character concepts, and how it will all come together, let’s get our footing. 

Whether you’re new to tabletop role playing, or a battle-scarred veteran of yesteryear, all good games begin with the same phrase... 

‘*...wouldn’t it be cool if...*’ 

----
Every day, we dream of things we crave. Whether it be that fi rst cup of coffee, our last day of fi nals, slaying at the gym, or fi nishing a project. We visualize the outcomes of daily life or set our wills to hard work, and then the magic happens: we imagine other things. We daydream about wide-open fi elds, trackless wilderness, friends clanging mugs in lanternlit taverns, freedom and exploration, swords fl ashing and heroism wellearned. For fantasy fans everywhere, this is a daily exercise... dreaming of a world of adventure. 

If you do this, you’re ready to role play. If you’ve role played before and you fi nd yourself dreaming of worlds beyond our own, it’s time to get back into the hobby. You, my friend, like me, are ripe with the substance of role playing: *concepts*. 

Role playing concepts are the simple foundation that you’ll bring to CROWN and SKULL. You’ll imagine yourself in each scene, your friends emerging from the landscape, your own details adding to a ‘living’ view of an imaginary universe. All the muscles of reading a great novel will serve you well here: translating words into images, and images into emotions. How do you fi t into it all? Wouldn’t it be cool if it was *you* in this story? 
This time, it *is* you. 

----
Role playing games have been around in the form we know them today since the late 1960’s. There’s no need to get too deep into a ‘what is role playing?’ discussion. Just get those daydreams in your head, see yourself in the pages to come, and you’ll be ready for anything.

The real skillset of role playing is the translation of concepts into playable content. Anyone can imagine themselves slaying a dragon with a silver sword. The art of the gaming hobby is codifying that scene into risks and uncertainties... making a gamble of it all, and seeing what happens. That art falls on you, dear reader, whether player or gamemaster (***GM***). 

----
- ***[[Introduction - World|World]]***: Much of this book portrays a world... The North Holds. This vast space is our backdrop, but its details are far more than stage setting. The world provides its own invitations, dilemmas, and challenges. Answering those calls is usually what sets things in motion. ^world

- ***[[Introduction - Characters|Characters]]***: Players change concepts into content by building mechanically sound and emotionally compelling characters. Heroes, hermits, and explorers all play their part... giving the world life. ^characters

- ***[[Introduction - Enemies|Enemies]]***: Before our heroes can do whatever they please, they’ll have foes to contend with. The GM will hurl all manner of monster at you. Is there any way around? Any hope? When is the sword the only choice? ^enemies

- ***[[Introduction - Dice|Dice]]***: To resolve the friction at play here, it’s time to roll dice. We can sway the results a bit, but there’s no telling what will happen. ^dice

- ***And then...*** After the dice have spoken, we’ll have to update our scene, change our perspective, take in new circumstances and press on. How we confront all this together is the content of a great tabletop game.

*Hail, reader. My name is Hankerin Ferinale, a mountain dwarf, intellectual, painter, fi sherman, brewmaster, cheese connoisseur and former battle commander. I’ll be weighin’ in on the text here and there, so mind ye my council!*

# A Player Focus
In many RPGs, the game master is an ever-deeper source of almost everything at the table besides role play and decision making. In combat, this becomes even more apparent, as a GM is often ‘thinking’ for numerous monsters and environmental hazards, making lots of rolls, and even assisting players with their roll targets and hoped-for output values. This can lead to a cognitive overload for GMs, but it is considered acceptable, as GMs are often the most enthusiastic about the hobby in general. In CROWN and SKULL, there is an intrinsic call to players: *you are now the focus! *

----
The term ‘player facing’ in the role playing hobby refers to rolls and mechanics that do not require input or answers from the GM. Rather, players need only consult their own sheet and resources, personal and unique to them, to make rolls, attempt actions, attack foes, and determine the output values of their work. Rather than asking ‘what’s my target on this roll?’ the player always knows the answer, rolling in the context of their skills and equipment. 

Just knowing what you’re trying to roll is hardly a robust ‘player facing’ game, though. Here’s where you, dear reader, are called upon to step up as a CROWN and SKULL player. In this game, there are numerous aspects aimed squarely at you. Let’s start with the ‘soft’ elements: 

----
- ***[[Introduction - Acquiring player expertise|Acquiring Player Expertise]]***: An expert player doesn’t just stay focused on the game, expedite turn time, lift up other players, and role play with the best of ‘em. Player expertise is also found in a deep comprehension of the mechanics and thematics in the game. This comes with time and attention. ^acquiring-player-expertise

- ***[[Introduction - Gathering character knowledge|Gathering Character Knowledge]]***: Your character will gain knowledge of foes, treasure, magic, politics, geography and more as they grow. This area is entirely your purview... the GM won’t remember to remember what you may or may not remember. ^gathering-character-knowledge

- ***[[Introduction - Finding synergy|Finding Synergy]]***: Throughout this book, there are numerous easy-to-miss interconnections. The masterful player fi nds and exploits these synergies with style and effect, making the most of the many details given. ^finding-synergy
----
Beyond the soft skills of a player focused game experience, we have the more mechanical expectations of this system... 

----
- ***[[Making Rolls • Player ATK|Making Rolls • Player ATK]]***: Since the GM has far fewer rolls to make, the player will fi nd themselves making a great deal more rolls throughout play. This places the burden of speedy play on the player! Rolling Defense to avoid a Formian mandible bite? Be ready, knowing what your target is, where your D20 is hiding, and the like. Knowing the ins and outs of your sheet becomes far more important when you are making 5 times the rolls of the GM. It also means there is seldom a dull moment. ^making-rolls

- ***[[Introduction - Building elements with points|Building Elements with Points]]***: It’s one thing to play skillfully within given elements and things-from-the-book. CROWN and SKULL takes ‘player facing’ to a whole new level by entrusting players with the construction of new and emergent elements of play by granting hero points. These points can be earned in many ways, and they allow you, the player, to invent spells, equipment and other progression abilities as play proceeds. ^building-elements-with-points
----

Who is the best designer of an RPG? The people playing it! If this level of involvement feels intimidating, you can always play what’s written. Go with your gut. 

CROWN and SKULL has total trust in the player. The more you explore this book, the more that should become apparent, and (I hope) offer you new vistas of creativity in your sessions and evolution.

----
*Synergy and customized flibbity jibbity! Bah! I’ve got a silly accent to perfect, a million drawings of my axe to finish, and these chips to eat! I’ll use gear, skills, and spells straight out o’ me tome, thank ye very much!*

----
# The North Holds
CROWN and SKULL takes place in a realm called The North Holds. This vast, diverse landscape is fi lled with cultures, secrets, and dangers for you to explore. It is a dark time, but thanks to you, there is always hope. 

----
**The North Holds** are recovering from a terrible time of calamity. Some 30 years before present day, The Bloodwing War ravaged the realm. The once-unifi ed lands no longer have a king, borders have decayed, wilds are more dangerous than ever. An age of order and ideas has come to an end. With no unifying rule, The North Holds struggle to find new purpose and new direction. An era of adventure. 

**Bloodwing** was a colossal green dragon, driven mad by a slime-entity called The Corruption. Since his rampage of desolation, dragons are widely feared by all but the elves of Dragon Tooth, and seldom seen. Only the very old remember a time when dragons and mortal folk were allies. 

**A formless evil** has been creeping into the world since the fall of Bloodwing. It is not fully understood, but the dreams of mortal folk are darkening. Rumor holds that the lord of Blood Manor is somehow behind this growing shadow. This is a mysterious fi gure known as Lord Royce, said by doomsayers to be ‘he who would drink the world.’ 

Despite all this, **good yet has a foothold**. Three once-tiny towns are on the rise with renewed ambition... havens for a new generation of adventurers. Long-standing tyrannies are being worn away by courageous defectors. The light challenges the darkness to retreat, and asks every soul in The Holds: will you choose the Crown, or the Skull? 

**An irrevocable choice**. As you grow and explore The North Holds during play, at some point a lord, king or elder wizard will offer you access to once-forbidden realms of knowledge and power. To make this exciting step in your journey, you will face a choice that can never be undone... you must choose either the CROWN or the SKULL. Both paths have secrets and skills to teach. Choose wisely! There are many foes of both sides in the wide world...

----
# Hometowns
If you’re looking over The North Holds world map, you may feel a bit lost. Who are we? Where are we, and why? CROWN and SKULL is a bit different from many RPGs, in that players can only begin the game in one of three possible locations. Your Hometown will define the feel and opening events of your game, and nearby areas accessible by foot travel. 

----
- ***[[Introduction - Gardenburrow forest refuge|Gardenburrow, Forest Refuge]]***: This town was founded by elves centuries ago as a waystation for forest caretakers and foragers. Since then, it has grown to a few hundred residents and many travelers crossing the West. To call this town home, you’ll be diving into mysterious forests, a longstanding feud with frog men, tensions with dwarves, and the mists of the Emerald Narrows. Gardenburrow is an elemental place... a pilgrimage for druids and nature-folk of the realm. ^gardenburrow-forest-refuge

- ***[[Introduction - Rivergate bustling trade city|Rivergate, Bustling Trade City]]***: At the geographic center point of The North Holds is the port city of Rivergate. This central location has made the ruling elite here wealthy, trading with the Stormkeeper dwarves and the abundant farms south of the River Thenne. Now that Ruinmoor has gone quiet, though, Rivergate is in crisis. To call this town home, you’ll be working for desperate nobles, escorting merchant barges, or exploring the fallen walls of ancient monasteries. Rivergate is the busy hub of mankind, with all its intrigue and peril. ^rivergate-bustling-trade-city

- ***[[Introduction - Slimshire high plains outpost|Slimshire, High Plains Outpost]]***: The coming of the ‘White Bird’ and The Holy Order has grown this town, once a wide spot in the road to Hakburg, to new heights. Ruling here is Lord Pickins, and times have been good. Such fortune has attracted the destructive attention of goblins from the Shadow Glades, Orc raiders from the deep desert, and even the darkly dreaming infl uence of a mysterious entity generally referred to as ‘the eye in the well.’ To call this town home, you will be confronting vampiric cults, fi ghting goblin skirmishers, or working to secure allies in the war with the Orcs. ^slimshire-high-plains-outpost

Before you choose a hometown, and all the thematic elements that come with it, let’s get into the rules of play...

----
# Game Flow
It’s one thing to describe towns, dream up adventures, or role play a heroic character. But this is a game not just a narrative, governed by chance and rules. When dice are being used to create surprising events, govern confl ict, or test character ability, you’ll be playing in the following flow. 

----
- ***[[Introduction - Setting the scene|Setting the Scene]]***: When a gathering with friends changes tone from chatter to gameplay, the GM will gather attention, set music and lights, ensure all players are ready to go, and begin. Through a series of descriptions, reminders, questions and confi rmations, a great GM will pull everyone back to a specifi c moment, where the story is waiting to continue. “The empire of frogs is at your doorstep, rallying columns of warriors in the marsh. The Alderman has chosen your company to defend the southern wall, entrusting you with the safety of the mysterious old man called Grimblegums. As the war-cry of frog-folk is heard, drums in the bog, we see our heroes at the ready. Grimblegums trembles with anticipation for the battle to come. Let’s get into it.” ^setting-the-scene

- ***[[Introduction - Phases and rounds|Phases and Rounds]]***: Once everyone is in the moment, the action kicks in. The great majority of play time happens in phases, moving from player to player around the table. The GM will call the next phase, and ask what you are doing. Descriptions become dice rolls and their hoped-for results. Enemies attack, the scene and terrain may change or escalate, and on it goes. A phase is one moment of action, a shared sliver of time between heroes and enemies. A round is one full set of phases for players and the GM. “In the fi nal seconds before the explosion, I bring my blade down on the evil commander! Victory is ours!” ^phases-and-rounds

- ***[[Introduction - Transitions and table talk|Transitions and Table Talk]]***: When a scene is concluded, the story will lurch forward. There will be GM descriptions, montages, player plans, and a short break. Players will be seeking means to rest or upgrade their characters. The GM will be revealing new truths, keep the danger pressing in, and offer little quarter for weary warriors. When the transition is complete, a new scene will be set and it all begins again. “As the smoke of battle clears, a new horror rises in the swamp... it’s already within a bowshot of the wall! Any actions in phase 1?” ^transitions-and-table-talk
